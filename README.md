# Interactive EIP-6963 tutorial
## Overview

This Ethereum Improvement Proposal aims to enhance connectivity in the blockchain space by introducing an alternative discovery mechanism to window.ethereum. By enabling the discovery of multiple injected wallet providers, EIP-6963 facilitates seamless communication between decentralized applications (DApps) and browser extension wallets.

## Quicker Start

For the quickest start, you can obtain a ready-to-use **InjectedWalletProvider** implementation. Simply put this file into your project:

<details>
<summary>InjectedWalletProvider</summary>

[injected-wallet-provider.ts](src/injected-wallet-provider/injected-wallet-provider.ts)

</details>


## The Plan

This tutorial will guide you through implementing **EIP-6963: Multi Injected Provider Discovery** from scratch. It consists of a few comprehensive sections:

### 1. Connection Flow

This section will explain the 'eip6963:requestProvider' and 'eip6963:announceProvider' events. It will provide a detailed explanation on how Decentralized Applications (DApps) can initiate connections with injected wallet providers. Furthermore, it will offer sample implementations of these and related interfaces that are essential for communication with the wallets.

The connection flow can be explored in steps 1-3 of the [interactive tutorial](https://eip-6963-tutorial.pages.dev/).

### 2. Persistence Handling

This section will illustrate how the browser maintains a connection with the wallet even after a page refresh. It will also demonstrate how to save a preferred wallet provider into localStorage for reuse after the page is refreshed.

The persistence handling can be explored in steps 4-5 of the [interactive tutorial](https://eip-6963-tutorial.pages.dev/).

### 3. Message Signing and Sending a Transaction

Show how your DApp can leverage connected wallet providers to sign transactions using their preferred wallet.

Using account to sign messages and send transactions can be explored in steps 6-7 of the [interactive tutorial](https://eip-6963-tutorial.pages.dev/).

> The code provided in the boxes has been intentionally simplified to keep the tutorial easy to percieve. For a fully working and integrated solution, please look into the application code.

## Section 0: Cloning and running the interactive tutorial app

#### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nfwsncked/eip-6963-tutorial.git
```

#### Navigate into the project directory

```bash
cd eip-6963-tutorial
```

#### Make sure installing all the deps
```bash
npm i
```

#### Run the project locally
```bash
npm run dev
```

#### Open served app in your browser
```
http://localhost:5173/
```


## Section 1: Connection Flow

Simplicity is the key. 

The EIP-6963 protocol operates in a simple manner: A DApp triggers the **'eip6963:requestProvider'** event, and in response, every EIP-6963 compatible wallet extension in your browser fires off the **'eip6963:announceProvider'** event.

To observe this interaction, we'll add an event listener for **'eip6963:announceProvider'** and trigger the **'eip6963:requestProvider'** event.

First we define **EIP6963RequestProviderEvent** to emit this event later

```typescript
class EIP6963RequestProviderEvent extends Event {
  constructor() {
    super("eip6963:requestProvider");
  }
};
```

Next, we are required to define the **EIP6963AnnounceProviderEvent** interface, which we will be monitoring.

```typescript
interface EIP6963AnnounceProviderEvent extends Event {
  type: "eip6963:announceProvider";
  detail: EIP6963ProviderDetail;
};

interface EIP6963ProviderDetail {
  info: EIP6963ProviderInfo;
  provider: EIP1193Provider;
};

interface EIP6963ProviderInfo {
  uuid: string;
  name: string;
  icon: string;
  rdns: string;
};

interface EIP1193Provider {
  request(request: { method: string, params?: Array<any> | Record<string, any> }): Promise<any>;
};
```

Note that we utilize the **'EIP1193Provider'** interface from the [EIP-1193 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193#appendix-i-consumer-facing-api-documentation). This implies that the provider emitted by a wallet extension is fully compatible with the one injected as **'window.ethereum'** before EIP-6963. Consequently, we can utilize all methods and events stated in the [EIP-1193 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193#appendix-i-consumer-facing-api-documentation).

In order for Typescript to recognize this custom event, we must augment the **WindowEventMap**:

```typescript
declare global {
  interface WindowEventMap {
    "eip6963:announceProvider": EIP6963AnnounceProviderEvent;
  }
}
```

Now we add **'EIP6963AnnounceProviderEvent'** event listener and emit **'EIP6963RequestProviderEvent'**

```typescript
onMounted(()  => {
  listenToAnnouncedProviders();
  requestProviders();
})

function listenToAnnouncedProviders() {
  window.addEventListener('eip6963:announceProvider', (event: EIP6963AnnounceProviderEvent) => {
    console.log(event.detail);
  });  
}

function requestProviders() {
  window.dispatchEvent(new EIP6963RequestProviderEvent());
}
```

So our final code would look like that:

```typescript
import {onMounted} from 'vue'

declare global {
  interface WindowEventMap {
    "eip6963:announceProvider": EIP6963AnnounceProviderEvent;
  }
}

class EIP6963RequestProviderEvent extends Event {
  constructor() {
    super("eip6963:requestProvider");
  }
};

interface EIP6963AnnounceProviderEvent extends Event {
  type: "eip6963:announceProvider";
  detail: EIP6963ProviderDetail;
};

interface EIP6963ProviderDetail {
  info: EIP6963ProviderInfo;
  provider: EIP1193Provider;
};

interface EIP6963ProviderInfo {
  uuid: string;
  name: string;
  icon: string;
  rdns: string;
};

interface EIP1193Provider {
  request(request: { method: string, params?: Array<any> | Record<string, any> }): Promise<any>;
};

const allProviderDetails = ref<EIP6963ProviderDetail[]>([]);
const selectedProviderDetail = ref<EIP6963ProviderDetail | null>(null);

const defaultProviderRdns = ref<string | null>(null);


onMounted(() => {
  readDefaultProviderRdns();
  listenToAnnouncedProviders();
  requestProviders();
})

function listenToAnnouncedProviders() {
  window.addEventListener('eip6963:announceProvider', (event: EIP6963AnnounceProviderEvent) => {
    console.log(`received 'eip6963:announceProvider' event: ${JSON.stringify(event.detail.info)}`);
    processAnnouncedProviderDetail(event.detail);
  });
}

function requestProviders() {
  console.log("emitting 'eip6963:requestProvider' event")
  allProviderDetails.value = [];
  window.dispatchEvent(new EIP6963RequestProviderEvent());
}

function processAnnouncedProviderDetail(providerDetail: EIP6963ProviderDetail) {
  allProviderDetails.value.push(providerDetail);
  console.log(`added '${providerDetail.info.name}' to allWalletProviders`)
}
```

Now you can see all the events emitted by wallet extensions in your console:

![001-events-in-console.png](docs/001-events-in-console.png)

We are particularly interested in **detail** parameter of the **'EIP6963ProviderDetail'**. It has two children: **info** and **provider**.

### EIP6963AnnounceProviderEvent.detail.info

The first one, **info**, holds all the metadata that the extension shares with the DApp. We have previously defined its interface as â€” **EIP6963ProviderInfo**:

Let's go one by one over the data points we received (descriptions were taken from [EIP-6963 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963#specification)):

> **uuid** â€” a globally unique identifier the Wallet Provider that MUST be (UUIDv4 compliant) to uniquely distinguish different EIP-1193 provider sessions that have matching properties defined below during the lifetime of the page. The cryptographic uniqueness provided by UUIDv4 guarantees that two independent EIP6963ProviderInfo objects can be separately identified.

**Important:** Please note that the 'uuid' will alter with each announcement, thus it cannot be reliably used to consistently identify the wallet extension.

> **name** â€” a human-readable local alias of the Wallet Provider to be displayed to the user on the DApp.

> **icon** â€” a URI pointing to an image. The image SHOULD be a square with 96x96px minimum resolution. See the Images/Icons below for further requirements of this property.The icon string MUST be a data URI as defined in RFC-2397. The image SHOULD be a square with 96x96px minimum resolution. The image format is RECOMMENDED to be either lossless or vector based such as PNG, WebP or SVG to make the image easy to render on the DApp. Since SVG images can execute Javascript, applications and libraries MUST render SVG images using the <img> tag to ensure no untrusted Javascript execution can occur.


> **rdns** â€” the Wallet MUST supply the rdns property which is intended to be a domain name from the Domain Name System in reverse syntax ordering such as com.example.subdomain. Itâ€™s up to the Wallet to determine the domain name they wish to use, but itâ€™s generally expected the identifier will remain the same throughout the development of the Wallet. Itâ€™s also worth noting that similar to a user agent string in browsers, there are times where the supplied value could be unknown, invalid, incorrect, or attempt to imitate a different Wallet. Therefore, the DApp SHOULD be able to handle these failure cases with minimal degradation to the functionality of the DApp. **The rdns (Reverse-DNS) property serves to provide an identifier which DApps can rely on to be stable between sessions.** The Reverse Domain Name Notation is chosen to prevent namespace collisions. The Reverse-DNS convention implies that the value should start with a reversed DNS domain name controlled by the Provider. 

**Important:** RDNS serves as a consistent parameter that enables us to identify the wallet across different sessions, we will use that later for persistency.


### EIP6963AnnounceProviderEvent.detail.provider

The second parameter, **provider**, is an interface we previously defined as **EIP1193Provider**. It functions as an exposed account provider, which you can utilize similarly to how you would use **window.ethereum**.

EIP1193Provider is an interface that represents the Ethereum provider API. It is a standard interface for Ethereum wallets that allows them to communicate with DApps. The EIP1193Provider interface has a method that is mostly used, 'request', which takes a request object as a parameter. The request object should have a 'method' property, which is a string representing the name of the method to be called, and an optional 'params' property, which can be an array or an object containing the parameters to be passed to the method. The 'request' method returns a Promise that resolves to the result of the method call. This allows DApps to interact with the Ethereum blockchain in an asynchronous manner, without blocking the user interface.

```typescript
await provider.request({method: 'eth_accounts'})

await provider.request({method: 'personal_sign', params: ['some message to sign', '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000']});

```

## Section 2: Persistence Handling

### eth_requestAccounts

After obtaining the provider for the wallet of choice, we can establish a connection with the accounts available in the wallet extension, to do so we use **'eth_requestAccounts'**:

```typescript
async function getCurrentAccount(): Promise<any> {
  const accounts = await provider.request({method: 'eth_requestAccounts'})
  setCurrentAccount(accounts[0])
}
```

This will trigger chosen extension to present a dialog to connect to the available account:

![002-request-accounts.png](docs/002-request-accounts.png)

You will see the following in the console:

`current account has been set to: 0x4adad79b327a627395a5ed54f051b64f42249d3d`

Which means our DApp successfully requested the accounts available in chosen extension.

**Important:** This process is being handled and stored within the extension itself, so connection between the DApp and the wallet extension will persist between page reloads and has to be done once per wallet extension.

### eth_accounts

To check for accounts that were previously connected to the DApp via chosen extension:

```typescript
async function isAccountConnected() {
  const accounts = await provider.request({method: 'eth_accounts'})
  if (accounts) {
    setCurrentAccount(accounts[0])
  }
}
```

Note that method **'eth_accounts'** we're triggering above is used to access to accounts already connected to the DApp before. We can use this method to connect to the available accounts after page refresh.

### localStorage

With EIP-6963 we are now able to use multiple wallet extensions simultaneously and this introduces a use-case when the user wants to use same wallet extension every time he uses our DApp. We can persist his choice by using localStorage to save RDNS value of the extension user has chosen. As we already mentioned before, RDNS parameter is a unique identifier provided by each wallet extension.

```typescript
function saveSelectedProviderAsDefault(selectedProviderInfo: EIP6963ProviderInfo) {
  window.localStorage.setItem(localStorageName, selectedProviderInfo.rdns)
  console.log(`default wallet provider was saved into localStorage: '${selectedProviderInfo.rdns}'`)
}
```

## Section 3: Message Signing and Sending a Transaction

This section shows how DApps can utilize connected wallet providers to sign transactions securely.

Let's start with an example of signing a string with the selected wallet:

```typescript
async function signWithSelectedProvider(msg: string, currentAccountAddress: string, selectedProviderInfo: EIP6963ProviderInfo) {
  const signature = await provider.request({method: 'personal_sign', params: [msg, currentAccountAddress]});
  console.log(`signed '${signatureInputText.value}' with ${selectedProviderInfo.name}, signature: ${signature}`);
}
```

Now we can utilize **'eth_sendTransaction'** to send a transaction into the network:

```typescript
async function sendTransactionWithSelectedProvider(txToAddress: string, currentAccountAddress: string, value: string) {
  const transactionParameters = {
      to: txToAddress,
      from: currentAccountAddress,
      value: value,
    };
    const txHash = await provider.request({
      method: 'eth_sendTransaction',
      params: [transactionParameters],
    });
    console.log(`transaction sent with hash: ${txHash}`);
}
```
